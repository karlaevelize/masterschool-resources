# Basic JavaScript Exercises

## Variables

In JavaScript, there are two ways to declare a variable: `let` and `const`. The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned, while the `const` keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

> `const` is the preferred way. Use `let` only when you need to reassign the variable.

### Exercises

1. Declare a variable named `name` and assign it a string value.
2. Declare a variable named `age` and assign it a number value.
3. Declare a variable named `isStudent` and assign it a boolean value.
4. Declare a variable named `hobbies` and assign it an array of strings.
5. Declare a variable named `person` and assign it an object with properties `name`, `age`, `isStudent`, and `hobbies`.

## Conditionals

In JavaScript, you can use the `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to execute different code blocks based on different conditions.

### Exercises

1. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a number is even or odd.
3. Write a JavaScript program that checks if a number is a multiple of 3 or 7.

## Functions

In JavaScript, you can define a function using the `function` keyword or the arrow function `=>`. Functions can take parameters and return values.

### Exercises

1. Write a JavaScript function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum.
2. Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as a parameter and returns the square.
3. Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a greeting message.
