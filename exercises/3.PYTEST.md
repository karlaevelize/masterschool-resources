# PyTest Exercises

## What is PyTest?

PyTest is a testing framework that allows you to write simple and scalable tests. It is a popular choice for testing in Python because it is easy to use and has a lot of features.

## Exercise 1: Calculator Tests

### Situation

You are a Python developer and you have been tasked with writing tests for a Python application. The application is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. You need to write tests for the calculator functions.

### Calculator

```python
# main.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Would you like to add, subtract, multiply, or divide?")

    operation = input()
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    if operation == "add":
        result = add(a, b)
    elif operation == "subtract":
        result = subtract(a, b)
    elif operation == "multiply":
        result = multiply(a, b)
    elif operation == "divide":
        result = divide(a, b)
    else:
        result = "Invalid operation"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

### Writing tests

1. Write a test for the `add` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

2. Write a test for the `subtract` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

3. Write a test for the `multiply` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

4. Write a test for the `divide` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

5. Write a test for the `divide` function that checks if it raises a `ValueError` when dividing by zero.

## Exercise 2: String Tests

### Situation

You are a Python developer and you have been tasked with writing tests for a Python application. The application is a simple string manipulation program that can reverse a string, capitalize a string, and check if a string is a palindrome. You need to write tests for the string functions.

### String Manipulation

```python
# main.py

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

def capitalize_string(s):
    return s.upper()

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Would you like to reverse, capitalize, or check if a string is a palindrome?")

    operation = input()
    s = input("Enter the string: ")

    if operation == "reverse":
        result = reverse_string(s)
    elif operation == "capitalize":
        result = capitalize_string(s)
    elif operation == "palindrome":
        result = is_palindrome(s)
    else:
        result = "Invalid operation"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

### Writing tests

1. Write a test for the `reverse_string` function that checks if it returns the correct result for a given string.

2. Write a test for the `capitalize_string` function that checks if it returns the correct result for a given string.

3. Write a test for the `is_palindrome` function that checks if it returns `True` for a palindrome string and `False` for a non-palindrome string.

## Exercise 3: List Tests

### Situation

You are a Python developer and you have been tasked with writing tests for a Python application. The application is a simple list manipulation program that can sort a list, find the maximum value in a list, and find the minimum value in a list. You need to write tests for the list functions.

### List Manipulation

```python
# main.py

def sort_list(lst):
    return sorted(lst)

def find_max(lst):
    return max(lst)

def find_min(lst):
    return min(lst)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Would you like to sort, find the maximum value, or find the minimum value in a list?")

    operation = input()
    lst = [int(x) for x in input("Enter the list of numbers separated by spaces: ").split()]

    if operation == "sort":
        result = sort_list(lst)
    elif operation == "max":
        result = find_max(lst)
    elif operation == "min":
        result = find_min(lst)
    else:
        result = "Invalid operation"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

### Writing tests

1. Write a test for the `sort_list` function that checks if it returns the correct result for a given list.

2. Write a test for the `find_max` function that checks if it returns the correct result for a given list.

3. Write a test for the `find_min` function that checks if it returns the correct result for a given list.
