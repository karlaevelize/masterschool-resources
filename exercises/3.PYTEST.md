# PyTest Exercises

## What is PyTest?

PyTest is a testing framework that allows you to write simple and scalable tests. It is a popular choice for testing in Python because it is easy to use and has a lot of features.

## Exercise 1: PyTest

### Situation

You are a Python developer and you have been tasked with writing tests for a Python application. The application is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. You need to write tests for the calculator functions.

### Calculator

```python
# main.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Would you like to add, subtract, multiply, or divide?")

    operation = input()
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    if operation == "add":
        result = add(a, b)
    elif operation == "subtract":
        result = subtract(a, b)
    elif operation == "multiply":
        result = multiply(a, b)
    elif operation == "divide":
        result = divide(a, b)
    else:
        result = "Invalid operation"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

### Writing tests

1. Write a test for the `add` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

2. Write a test for the `subtract` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

3. Write a test for the `multiply` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

4. Write a test for the `divide` function that checks if it returns the correct result for two positive numbers.

5. Write a test for the `divide` function that checks if it raises a `ValueError` when dividing by zero.
