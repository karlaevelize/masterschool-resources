## Exercise 1: Secret Santa

### Situation

It's that time of the year again! While the world is preparing for the holidays, you and your friends are planning a Secret Santa gift exchange. Since you are the developer of the group, you have been tasked with creating a Python program that will randomly assign a Secret Santa to each person.

### Requirements

#### Main Requirements

1. Create a list of names of the people participating in the Secret Santa.
2. Write a function that will randomly assign a Secret Santa to each person.
3. The function should not assign a person to themselves.

#### Bonus Requirements

1. The program should not assign a person to the same Secret Santa as the previous year.
2. People should be able to select who they do not want to be assigned as their Secret Santa. For example: Couples who do not want to be assigned to each other.

### Testing

- Implement a test case for the main requirements:
  - Check if all items in the list are strings
  - Check if the function returns a dictionary with the same length as the list
  - Check if the function does not assign a person to themselves
